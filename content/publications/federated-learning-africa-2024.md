# Extended Abstract

Healthcare data sharing in Sub-Saharan Africa faces unique challenges including limited connectivity, privacy regulations, and resource constraints. This research proposes a novel federated learning framework that addresses these specific challenges.

## Key Contributions

1. **Adaptive Communication Protocol**: Designed for intermittent connectivity common in rural healthcare facilities
2. **Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms**: Implementing differential privacy with cultural and regulatory considerations
3. **Resource-Efficient Training**: Optimized for low-power devices and limited computational resources

## Experimental Results

Our framework was tested across 15 healthcare facilities in Cameroon, Nigeria, and Kenya:

- **92% accuracy** in disease prediction tasks
- **60% reduction** in communication overhead
- **Zero privacy breaches** during 6-month deployment

## Societal Impact

This work contributes to:
- Improved healthcare outcomes in underserved communities
- Preservation of patient privacy across borders
- Capacity building in AI/ML for African healthcare professionals
