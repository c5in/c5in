# Thesis Abstract

Small-scale agriculture represents the backbone of Cameroon's economy, yet farmers face significant challenges including climate variability, limited access to modern farming techniques, and resource constraints. This thesis investigates how Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can be adapted and deployed to support small-scale farmers in improving their agricultural productivity and sustainability.

## Research Objectives

1. **Design affordable IoT solutions** suitable for small-scale farming operations
2. **Develop context-aware systems** that account for local environmental and socio-economic conditions
3. **Evaluate the impact** of IoT adoption on farming productivity and farmer livelihoods
4. **Create sustainable deployment models** for technology transfer and maintenance

## Methodology

The research employed a mixed-methods approach combining:
- **Participatory design** with 120 farmers across 3 regions of Cameroon
- **Technical development** of low-cost sensor networks and mobile applications
- **Field trials** over 18 months across different crop types and seasons
- **Economic impact assessment** using before-and-after comparisons

## Key Findings

### Technical Contributions
- Development of solar-powered sensor nodes costing under $50 each
- Creation of SMS-based alert systems for farmers without smartphones
- Design of offline-capable mobile applications for data collection and analysis

### Socio-Economic Impact
- **25% increase** in crop yields for participating farmers
- **30% reduction** in water usage through precision irrigation
- **40% decrease** in pesticide application through targeted interventions
- **Improved income stability** through better crop planning and market timing

### Sustainability Model
- Training of local technicians for system maintenance
- Development of farmer cooperatives for cost-sharing
- Integration with existing agricultural extension services

## Implications for Policy and Practice

This research provides evidence-based recommendations for:
- **Government policy** on agricultural technology adoption
- **NGO programs** supporting smallholder farmers
- **Private sector** development of appropriate technologies
- **Academic institutions** conducting applied research in agriculture

## Future Research Directions

The thesis identifies several areas for continued investigation:
- Integration with climate prediction models
- Blockchain-based supply chain traceability
- AI-powered crop disease detection
- Regional scaling and technology transfer mechanisms
